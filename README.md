# Wally
## A self-hosted, cooperative place to collect map markers

Named after the famous cartographer Wally B. Feed, Wally is a self-hosted PHP application that allows you to store markers on a map and categorize them, put them into lists, assigm icons to them and save details inside the markers.
Markers, categories, groups and the whole map can be shared with others, giving them read or write access to contribute.

### Why PHP?

Despite its bad reputation, it matured well and - most importantly I believe - it is available on every toaster. What good is self-hosted software if it's only available for people who know how to properly work with containers?

### Installation

Installation is as easy as copying a handful of files and you are done.
No matter what crappy shared hosting you have lying around, it will most likely just work out of the box.
No need for layers upon layers of devops. Keep it simple.
